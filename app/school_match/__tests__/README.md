# School Match Page Testing Documentation

## Test Overview

This document describes the comprehensive testing setup for the School Match page component, which helps students find colleges based on their preferences and academic profile.

## Key Differences from Major Mentor Tests

The School Match page has **5 input stages** instead of 3, and uses different field types:

### Input Stages:
1. **Location** - State/country preference
2. **Location Requirements** - Specific location needs
3. **Future Plans** - Career/academic goals
4. **Ideal Campus Experience** - Campus preferences
5. **Unweighted GPA** - Academic profile

## Test Structure

### Test File: `app/school_match/__tests__/page.test.tsx`

#### Component Mocks
All major dependencies are mocked to isolate the component under test:

- `ProductWelcome` - Displays welcome section for School Match Maker
- `PromptReq` - Handles AI college recommendation requests
- `TextInput` - Text input component for all 5 stages
- `EditableCard` - Editable summary cards for completed stages

#### Test Coverage (90.74% statement coverage)

11. **handles invalid JSON response gracefully** ‚úÖ
    - Tests malformed response handling (simplified test)
    - Verifies component doesn't crash on invalid data

### Data Persistence & UI Tests

12. **displays recommendation cards with correct structure** ‚úÖ
    - Verifies proper card layout and content
    - Tests multiple college recommendations display
    - Checks for required UI elements:
      - "Description of College" sections
      - "Why This College:" sections
    - Validates specific content display

13. **maintains user input state when navigating between stages** ‚úÖ
    - Tests data persistence across stage navigation
    - Verifies input values are retained when editing
    - Ensures form state management works correctly
    - Tests with realistic data: "Florida" location

14. **displays proper stage progression labels** ‚úÖ
    - Tests that each stage shows the correct question text
    - Verifies proper progression through different questions:
      - Stage 1: Location question
      - Stage 2: Location requirements question
      - Stage 3: Future plans question

15. **shows all editable cards after completing multiple stages** ‚úÖ
    - Tests that multiple completed stages show multiple editable cards
    - Verifies correct number of cards displayed (3 cards after 3 stages)
    - Ensures proper summary display

## Test Data

### Mock College Recommendations
```json
[
  {
    "option1": {
      "collegeName": "University of California, Los Angeles",
      "descriptionOfCollege": "A prestigious public research university in Los Angeles.",
      "whyThisCollege": "Perfect for your career goals and academic interests."
    }
  },
  {
    "option2": {
      "collegeName": "Stanford University",
      "descriptionOfCollege": "A leading private research university in California.",
      "whyThisCollege": "Excellent for technology and innovation-focused students."
    }
  }
]
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Component Isolation**: All dependencies properly mocked
2. **Realistic Data**: Uses actual college names and realistic user inputs
3. **Comprehensive Flow Testing**: Tests complete 5-stage user journey
4. **Error Scenario Coverage**: Tests both generation and star toggle failures
5. **State Management Testing**: Verifies complex multi-stage state handling
